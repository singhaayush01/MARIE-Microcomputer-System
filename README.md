Title: Project 3 — MARIE Micro-Computer System (Advanced)

Name: Aayush Kumar Singh
Course: CSIS 3740 — Computer Organization
Instructor: Dr. Hailong Jiang

🔹 1. Objectives

This project focused on understanding how the MARIE CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions. I implemented the SKIPCOND instruction and added a new CLEAR instruction, while completing a two-pass assembler and CPU simulator in C++.

🔹 2. Implementation Summary

Assembler: Added full SKIPCOND encoding (LT, ZE, GT) and label handling.

Simulator: Implemented instruction execution and condition skipping.

Extra Instruction: CLEAR (0xB) resets the accumulator (AC ← 0).

Testing: Used loop.asm and skipcond_test.asm; verified output and trace table matched expected results.

🔹 3. Results

The assembler generated correct machine code identical to the provided reference (loop.txt).

The simulator executed programs accurately, showing correct PC, IR, AC, MAR, MBR values in the trace output.

skipcond_test.asm successfully skipped the intended instruction when AC > 0.

🔹 4. Reflection

Through this project I learned how low-level instruction decoding and control logic operate inside a CPU. Writing a two-pass assembler improved my understanding of label resolution and instruction encoding. Implementing SKIPCOND helped me connect Boolean conditions to micro-architectural control flow. Overall, this project deepened my grasp of how hardware executes assembly instructions step-by-step.
